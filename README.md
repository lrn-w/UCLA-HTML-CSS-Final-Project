# UCLA-HTML-CSS-Final-Project
This repository contains my submission for the final project in UCLA's Extension HTML/CSS course. The submission is a website created with a mobile-first design, with responsive media queries that adjust as the screen size increases. It is an accumulation of the skills learned in the course ranging from HTML5, CSS, and JS. We also used W3C validator to validate the HTML code.
